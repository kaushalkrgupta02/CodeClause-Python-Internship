<h1> { Code Clause }; </h1>
This repo contains an internship project under the Codeclause internship program.
I have to delegate some projects, and I have to produce two of them.

1. Web Scrapper: Build a web scraper using libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to extract data.
from a website. For example, scrape news headlines from a news website.
:- I have used beautifulsoup libraray and scrap lines of the treading/lateest news section of a popular Indian news media company.
Note that there is only a Python script, and hence results are printed only on code editor terminals.


2. Music Player in Python: Develop a music player using Python that allows users to play, stop, and pause music and select a folder to play all songs within that folder.
:- I have used Tkinter and made it attractive using icons, and all features have been implemented as per the directions given.
